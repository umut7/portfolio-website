This website serves as an online portfolio to showcase a variety of projects. It is connected to my GitHub repository, meaning that whenever a new project is added to GitHub, the website will automatically update itself. This seamless integration ensures that the portfolio is always up-to-date with the latest work, allowing visitors to easily explore the newest projects, view descriptions, and navigate through various sections. The site also features a dark/light mode toggle and a clean, user-friendly interface.
