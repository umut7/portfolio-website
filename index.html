                <p>
                    I am a recent graduate of Software Engineering from YaÅŸar University. During my studies, I built a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, focusing on practical applications. Through various projects, I have gained hands-on experience with tools like Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and BeautifulSoup. I have also created interactive data visualizations with Streamlit and worked with Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to analyze and present insights effectively.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In my projects, I have worked on topics like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), reinforcement learning, and regression. I also have experience with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Decision Trees. My data science work includes projects in customer analytics, recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, financial data analysis, energy time series analysis, and portfolio optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on these projects has also helped me improve my teamwork and project management skills. I enjoy solving problems, focusing on quality, and paying attention to detail. I am excited to apply my skills in data science, machine learning, and AI to meaningful projects and collaborate with skilled teams.
